~~~ Overview ~~~

A roguelike for the purpose of learning Japanese, with kanji tiles and Japanese text.
The core engine and the game itself will be developed in a compartmentalised way, so that the core engine can be reused in future projects.


~~~ To-Do ~~~

-> Add onClick to entities
--> Open a pop-up with an image of the entity (e.g. '猫' -> photo of a cat).
